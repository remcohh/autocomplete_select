AutocompleteSelect
==================

Replacement for select form helper using prototypejs autocomplete to
select an associated object in a form.


Example
=======

Here's a very simple example where a book belongs to an author:

In app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
  <%= autocomplete_select_includes %>

In app/views/books/_form.html.erb:

  <%= book_form.autocomplete_select :author_id %>

In app/models/author.rb:

  named_scope :search, lambda{|q| {:conditions => ["name LIKE ?", "%#{q}%"]}}
  alias_method :to_s, :name

In app/controllers/authors_controller.rb:

  def index
    @authors = Author.search params[:search]
  end

In app/views/authors/index.autocomplete.erb

  <%= autocomplete_list @authors %>

Don't forget to run: +rake autocomplete_select:install_assets+
